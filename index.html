								<p>I got interest in IT as when I completed my senior secondary education then I move forward to study in abroad and after surfing on internet and asking people about great opportunities available in IT department I came close to IT field.I choose RMIT University as I want to study abroad and after knowing the teaching faculty and worldwide reputation I come over to RMIT.I undertake a undergraduate course (Bachelors of Information Technology)and further I want to gain professional knowledge in this field.</p>
								<p>The biggest part of studying information technology is practical. Doing an information technology course, I won’t just learn the theoretical part but also get the opportunity to make things. With that, I can change or adjust things and implement what I’ve learned. Knowledge is important to any career field. It’s sometimes better to see what you’re learning by actually doing it. That way I’ll remember things quicker and longer and become successful in your field.</p>

								<p><h3Developing a mobile app</h3>making up app which could deliver yuor laundry items to your address<br>Discovery and Market Research Once an app idea/concept is generated, it is important to put in the efforts to do a proper market study and find out the viability of the project. Sometimes, market research will result in the discovery of new ideas. The research stage is not only meant to discover new ideas but also to come up with the list of requirements needed to fix the scope of your app project.Having clear answers to the following questions upfront will go a long way in ensuring the success of your app development project.App Objective: What is the aim of your mobile app? Where does it fit in the overall mobility/ digital transformation roadmap for your business? What problem (or problems) will your app solve for your users?Target Audience:This app will target the general public mostly aging between (25-50)App USP: the app will have various types of features like they want their cloths dried or fully washed or somethingTarget Platforms: compatible with booth android and IOS.App Investment: requires low amount of budget<br>App Design (UX/UI).The user interface (UI) and experience design (UX) are two crucial factors that determine the success of any mobile application. While UI design provides the visual medium that manifests the app to the user, UX design speaks about multiple aspects of human interaction with the app. Not to mention, the design should be interactive and engaging.The design stage includes multiple aspects which are discussed below.<br>Information Architecture & WorkflowsInformation architecture is the design framework in which the data, interface, and functionality of the app are specified and detailed. Ideally, the technology architecture and the technology stack must be finalized before establishing the design details.Often, this includes details about the platform and also how the app fits within the platform. For example, a new app that helps the user to maintain a work schedule may depend on the system clock. Workflow or process flow is useful in depicting how the app is used in a step-by-step process.<br>Prototypes.While mockups provide a display of your mobile app’s functionality using static designs, prototypes can provide a glimpse into the working of the apps.A prototype is a rapid version of the originally intended app. Prototypes are specifically required if the technology is new, concepts are untested or there is uncertainty about the app development. While mockups are dummy runs of the app, prototypes provide the “real feeling” or “demo” version of the app. It can be even used as a demo of the app.Prototypes can be handy for understanding the visual interface, user experience and the app’s flow of work that is expected from the finished product. Prototype development can be time-consuming but it offers short testing of your app’s design and functionality which can come very handy in the later stages.</p>
